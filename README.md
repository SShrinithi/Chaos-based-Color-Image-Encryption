# Chaos-based-Color-Image-Encryption
A secure chaos-based color image two-layer encryption scheme using Chirikov, LSM+LCG, and Lorenz maps with full statistical and NIST SP 800-22 analysis.

The rapid development of multimedia generation and transmission over insecure networks has increased the demand for strong and effective image encryption methods. Traditional encryption techniques such as DES, 3DES, and AES, while good for textual data, are less appropriate for images because of intrinsic characteristics such as high redundancy and high pixel correlations. Chaos-based encryption schemes have become a viable alternative with properties like sensitivity to initial conditions and pseudo-randomness that meet Shannon's cryptographic requirements of confusion and diffusion. To this end, this paper introduces a color image encryption scheme that combines the Chirikov Standard Map with chaotic systems such as the 2D Logistic-Sine map with a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG), and the 3D Lorenz system. The process of diffusion is managed by pixel shuffling using the Chirikov Standard Map, while the confusion is made robust through the use of two independently generated chaotic keys. A comprehensive literature review indicates that most previous chaos-based schemes tended to concentrate disproportionately on either diffusion or confusion, creating vulnerabilities; the scheme fills this lack by realizing a balanced, two-layer encryption framework.

The performance of the algorithm was thoroughly tested and validated using extensive testing, such as statistical analysis, entropy testing, correlation testing, differential attack resistance, and adherence to the NIST SP 800-22 randomness requirements. Results show outstanding resistance to visual, statistical, differential, and brute-force attacks, proving the strength and practical feasibility of the encryption scheme. In addition, the randomness tests prove the creation of highly unpredictable cipher images, guaranteeing secure multimedia transmission. In summary, the suggested encryption algorithm provides a valuable contribution to chaos-based image encryption with high security, and computational effectiveness.
